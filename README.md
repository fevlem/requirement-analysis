# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repository is dedicated to understanding and documenting the process of requirement analysis in software development. It serves as a resource for learning about the importance, methods, and best practices of gathering and analyzing software requirements

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified software product. It is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where developers and stakeholders collaborate to define, document, and validate the needs that must be met by the software solution.

During requirement analysis, the development team:

.Gathers information from stakeholders
.Identifies functional and non-functional requirements
.Analyzes and prioritizes requirements
.Documents specifications clearly
.Resolves any conflicts or ambiguities in requirements
.This phase bridges the gap between business needs and technical implementation, ensuring the final product aligns with user expectations and business objectives.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is crucial in SDLC for several reasons:

1.Reduces Development Risks: Proper requirement analysis helps identify potential problems early in the process, reducing the likelihood of costly changes during later stages of development.

2.Ensures Customer Satisfaction: By thoroughly understanding and documenting user needs, the development team can build a product that truly meets customer expectations, leading to higher satisfaction and adoption rates.

3.Improves Project Efficiency: Clear requirements help in accurate project planning, resource allocation, and timeline estimation, leading to more efficient development processes and reduced rework.

4.Facilitates Better Communication: Well-documented requirements serve as a common reference point for all stakeholders, including developers, testers, and business teams, ensuring everyone shares the same understanding of the project goals.

5.Cost-Effectiveness: Identifying and fixing requirement issues early is significantly less expensive than making changes after development has begun or after product release.

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The requirement analysis process typically involves these key activities:

.Requirement Gathering: Collecting information about what the system should do from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and workshops.

.Requirement Elicitation: Extracting hidden or unexpressed needs through techniques like brainstorming, prototyping, and user observation.

.Requirement Documentation: Creating clear, structured documents such as Software Requirements Specification (SRS) that detail all requirements.

.Requirement Analysis and Modeling: Using diagrams (like use cases, flowcharts) and analysis techniques to understand relationships between requirements and identify conflicts.

.Requirement Validation: Ensuring requirements are complete, consistent, and achievable through reviews, prototyping, and test case development.

## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define what the system should do. Examples for a booking management system:

.The system shall allow users to search for available rooms by date range
.The system shall enable registered users to make reservations
.The system shall process online payments for bookings
.The system shall send confirmation emails after successful bookings
.The system shall allow users to view their booking history
### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define how the system should perform. Examples:

.The system shall handle 1000 concurrent users during peak hours (Performance)
.The booking process shall complete within 5 seconds (Speed)
.The system shall be available 99.9% of the time (Availability)
.User data shall be encrypted during transmission (Security)
.The interface shall support English and French languages (Localization)
# Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams are visual representations of interactions between system users (actors) and the system itself. They help:

.Identify system functionality
.Show relationships between actors and use cases
.Provide a high-level overview of system requirements
# Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria are conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete. They help:


Define feature boundaries
Guide development and testing
Ensure stakeholder expectations are met
Example for a Checkout feature in booking system:

1. When a user proceeds to checkout, the system shall display all booking details including:
     Room type
     Dates
     Total price with taxes
2. The system shall accept payment via:
      Credit cards (Visa, MasterCard)
      PayPal
3. After successful payment:
        A confirmation number shall be generated
        A confirmation email shall be sent to the user's registered email
        The booking status shall change to "Confirmed" in the database
4. If payment fails:
         The system shall display an appropriate error message
         The booking shall remain in "Pending" status for 30 minutes
         The user shall be allowed to retry payment
